Testing

This portal is where I share some of my interests from DNN implementation to an online shopping area. This portal itself will be a test-bed for .NET modules, skins, containers, and of course upgrades. The blog will contain ideas, questions, and how I overcame obstacles when developing some of my projects.

The shopping area of this site will have items that I purchased, use and have found to be superior. Items may not be the least expensive, or be well known, but have proven to me that they are of the highest standards in there respective areas.

If after visiting some of our project websites, you have any questions or comments, please send us an email at admin@TekZones.com. If you have a need for web hosting and or website development, you can send your requirements to the email above, and I will get back to with an estimate and approximate time for completion.

Thank You,  
Robert F. Havens  
Founder and Developer
